### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Baptiste, graduated as Electrical & Software Engineer in France few years ago.
I started to learn web & mobile dev by my self many years ago to become fullstack developer and I specialized for 2-3 years into Flutter apps development.
This framework is AMAZING, so developer friendly, allowing to produce awesome crossplatform apps.

For an overview: https://flutter.dev/

I'm working as freelance developer for 2 years, I invite you to check my portfolio right here: https://baptistesx.github.io/port-folio/

I'm currently opened for new opportunities as freelance or to be employee in a company in Barcelona, Spain.
