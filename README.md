### Hi there 👋

I'm Baptiste, I graduated as an Electrical ⚡ & Software Engineer 💻 in France 🇫🇷 a few years ago. I started web & mobile development by myself many years ago to become a full stack developer and I have spent the past 3 years specializing in Flutter development 📱.
This framework is AMAZING 🤩 and developer friendly, allowing us to produce awesome cross-platform apps.

For an overview: https://flutter.dev/

I have been working as a freelance developer for 2 years, and I invite you to check out my portfolio right here:

- a full time position as Sr Mobile Developer in Barcelona 🇪🇸
- full time or part time missions as freelance
