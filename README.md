### Hi there 👋

I'm Baptiste, graduated as an Electrical ⚡ & Software Engineer 💻 in France 🇫🇷 few years ago. I started web & mobile development by myself many years ago to become a full stack developer and I have specialized for almost 3 years in Flutter app development 📱.
This framework is AMAZING, 🤩 developer friendly, allowing us to produce awesome crossplatform apps.

For an overview: https://flutter.dev/

I have been working as a freelance developer for 2 years, and I invite you to check out my portfolio right here:

🚀🚀 I'm currently open for new opportunities 👐 as a freelance or as an employee at a company in Barcelona, Spain 🇪🇸.
